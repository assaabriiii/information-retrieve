Yet today there is only oneâhomo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us?Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas.Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become?Featuring 27 photographs, 6 maps, and 25 illustrations/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem. ...more",Â£54.23,In stock (20 available),History,Five,http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/sapiens-a-brief-history-of-humankind_996/index.html,data/books/html/book_5.html,renowned historian come groundbreaking narrative humanityâs creation evolutionâa international bestsellerâthat explores way biology history defined u enhanced understanding mean âhumanâone hundred thousand year ago least six different specie human inhabited earth yet today oneâh renowned historian come groundbreaking narrative humanityâs creation evolutionâa international bestsellerâthat explores way biology history defined u enhanced understanding mean âhumanâone hundred thousand year ago least six different specie human inhabited earth yet today oneâhomo sapiens happened others may happen usmost book history humanity pursue either historical biological approach dr yuval noah harari break mold highly original book begin year ago appearance modern cognition examining role evolving human played global ecosystem charting rise empire sapiens integrates history science reconsider accepted narrative connect past development contemporary concern examine specific event within context larger ideasdr harari also compels u look ahead last decade human begun bend law natural selection governed life past four billion year acquiring ability design world around u also leading u want becomefeaturing photograph map illustrationsdiagrams provocative insightful work sure spark debate essential reading aficionado jared diamond james gleick matt ridley robert wright sharon moalem,0

More than 140 years pre-Hillary, there was Victoria Woodhull. This book takes you back with a breathtaking, present-tense bird's eye view into a time when women's liberation was primarily confined to one woman's very capable, independent mind. I couldn't put it down.""---Ruth Buzzi, Golden Globe Award winner and Television Hall of Fame inductee""Sadly, too many Americans have never heard of Victoria Woodhull, let alone learned of her story: her revolutionary campaign for the presidency at a time when women weren't even allowed to vote, her support for worker's rights, or her feminist commitment to equality, a century before the official battle over the Equal Rights Amendment. But in The Coming Woman, Karen Hicks brings Woodhull's efforts to life, and reminds us that some of our nation's greatest figures aren't always featured in the history books. It is a riveting account of an amazing woman and her struggle for justice and human dignity, told in an engaging and eminently readable style.""-Tim Wise, author, ""White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son""""The Coming Woman"" is a novel based on the life of feminist Victoria Woodhull, the first woman to run for U.S. President, 50 years before women could even vote!Running for President wasn't Victoria's only first as a woman. She was also the first to own a successful Wall Street firm, the first to publish a successful national newspaper, and the first to head the two-million-member Spiritualist Association. She was the first woman to enter the Senate Judiciary Committee chambers to petition for woman's suffrage, her argument changing the entire focus of the suffragist movement by pointing out that the 14th and 15th Amendments already gave women the vote.In her campaign for the Presidency, Victoria Woodhull boldly addressed many of the issues we still face today: equal pay for equal work; freedom in love; corporate greed and political corruption fueled by powerful lobbyists; and the increasing disparity between the rich and the poor, to name only a few. Her outspoken and common-sense ideas may shed a new perspective on the parallel conundrums of today's world.This bold, beautiful, and sexually progressive woman dared to take on society and religion. To make an example of the hypocrisy in what Mark Twain dubbed The Gilded Age, she exposed the extramarital affairs of the most popular religious figure of the day (Henry Ward Beecher). This led to her persecution and imprisonment and the longest, most infamous trial of the 19th century. But it did not stop her fight for equality.Victoria's epic story, set in the late 1800s, comes to life in a modern, fictional style, while staying true to the actual words and views of the many well-known characters. ...more",Â£17.93,In stock (19 available),Default,Three,http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/the-coming-woman-a-novel-based-on-the-life-of-the-infamous-feminist-victoria-woodhull_993/index.html,data/books/html/book_8.html,heart soul karen hick coming woman make fall love victoria woodhullkinky friedman author governor heart texas kind confidence would take woman buck old boy club politics year prehillary victoria woodhull book take back heart soul karen hick coming woman make fall love victoria woodhullkinky friedman author governor heart texas kind confidence would take woman buck old boy club politics year prehillary victoria woodhull book take back breathtaking presenttense bird eye view time womens liberation primarily confined one woman capable independent mind couldnt put downruth buzzi golden globe award winner television hall fame inducteesadly many american never heard victoria woodhull let alone learned story revolutionary campaign presidency time woman werent even allowed vote support worker right feminist commitment equality century official battle equal right amendment coming woman karen hick brings woodhull effort life reminds u nation greatest figure arent always featured history book riveting account amazing woman struggle justice human dignity told engaging eminently readable styletim wise author white like reflection race privileged sonthe coming woman novel based life feminist victoria woodhull first woman run u president year woman could even voterunning president wasnt victoria first woman also first successful wall street firm first publish successful national newspaper first head twomillionmember spiritualist association first woman enter senate judiciary committee chamber petition woman suffrage argument changing entire focus suffragist movement pointing th th amendment already gave woman votein campaign presidency victoria woodhull boldly addressed many issue still face today equal pay equal work freedom love corporate greed political corruption fueled powerful lobbyist increasing disparity rich poor name outspoken commonsense idea may shed new perspective parallel conundrum today worldthis bold beautiful sexually progressive woman dared take society religion make example hypocrisy mark twain dubbed gilded age exposed extramarital affair popular religious figure day henry ward beecher led persecution imprisonment longest infamous trial th century stop fight equalityvictorias epic story set late come life modern fictional style staying true actual word view many wellknown character,1

The sons of loggers, shipyard workers, and farmers, the boys defeated elite rivals first from eastern and British universities and finally the German crew rowing for Adolf Hitler in the Olympic games in Berlin, 1936. The emotional heart of the story lies with one rower, Joe Rantz, a teenager without family or prospects, who rows not for glory, but to regain his shattered self-regard and to find a place he can call home. The crew is assembledÂ  by an enigmatic coach and mentored by a visionary, eccentric British boat builder, but it is their trust in each other that makes them a victorious team. They remind the country of what can be done when everyone quite literally pulls togetherâa perfect melding of commitment, determination, and optimism. Drawing on the boysâ own diaries and journals, their photos and memories of a once-in-a-lifetime shared dream, The Boys in the Boat is an irresistible story about beating the odds and finding hope in the most desperate of timesâthe improbable, intimate story of nine working-class boys from the American west who, in the depths of the Great Depression, showed the world what true grit really meant.

There is in her art the vulnerability of one who lives inside of the stories that she gathers in this remarkable collection. Her poems set off alarms even as they transform the world she inhabits, showing us, in the process, exactly what she asks of Romare Beardenâs art: ââ¦how not to // assign all blackness near the sea / a captivity.â This is one of the many sweet contradictions in the black maria, which âis a black flag / wounding the pastoral.â I am deeply thankful that we have a poet of her unique and singular talent writing today."" âKwame DawesTaking its name from the moon's dark plains, misidentified as seas by early astronomers, the black maria investigates African diasporic histories, the consequences of racism within American culture, and the question of human identity. Central to this project is a desire to recognize the lives of Eritrean refugees who have been made invisible by years of immigration crisis, refugee status, exile, and resulting statelessness. The recipient of a 2015 Whiting Award for Poetry, Girmay's newest collection elegizes and celebrates life, while wrestling with the humanistic notion of seeing beyond: seeing violence, seeing grace, and seeing each other better.""to the sea""great storage house, historyon which we rode, we touchedthe brief pulse of your flutteringpages, spelled with salt & life,your rage, your indifferenceyour gentleness washing our feet,all of you going onwhether or not we live,to you we bring our carnationsyellow & pink, how they floatlike bright sentences atopyour memory's dark hairAracelis Girmay is the author of three poetry collections, the black maria; Kingdom Animalia, which won the Isabella Gardner Award and was a finalist for the NBCC Award; and Teeth.
